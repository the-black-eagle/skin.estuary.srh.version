# skin.estuary.srh.version
My mod of the Kodi 18 (Leia) version of Estuary.

Modded to support script.radio.streaming.helper <https://github.com/the-black-eagle/script.radio.streaming.helper/tree/development> which adds art and track/artist info to songs played via streaming radio stations (Development branch is needed for Kodi V18 compatibility)

Requires - script.artistslideshow, script.skin.helper.service, script.radio.streaming.helper

Based off pkscouts estuary mod which includes the following :

ability to reorder and turn off home screen left menu items
ability to reorder and deactivate sub-menu widgets
option to use small icons for the categories
ability to change the action of most of the main menu items (to one of a preset group of choices based on the menu item)
added a new TV Show widget called Unwatched/In Progress Shows (it's off by default)
setting to change the color diffusion of background art (from 0 - 100%)
support for Artist Slideshow on the music visualization screen (including artist bio) if Artist Slideshow is installed
option to trigger music visualization screen when you start playing music
option to use alternate layout for weather widget in top bar that doesn't overlap with certain views
added categories in TV category widget for X-NEWA and Pseudolibrary if those addons are installed
option to use an alternate timer layout that puts the show name before the channel name in the PVR listings
better support for 4 digit channel numbers in PVR
option to use the Weather menu as a weather clock (really only works with a RPi 9" touchscreen, requires additional addon <https://github.com/pkscout/script.weatherstation.lite> and software <https://github.com/pkscout/rpi.weatherstation.lite>)
